# GitHub User Activity

Sample solution for the [github-user-activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

In this project, I build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

Features:

- Fetch the recent activity of the specified GitHub user using the GitHub API.
- Display the fetched activity in the terminal
